# HORT5102-2024

This repository contains the class materials for the HORT5102 course (2024) at National Taiwan University. These materials, originally developed by the creators of [Cropbox](https://github.com/cropbox/Cropbox.jl), have been adapted for instructional purposes.

## Course Information

### Coure Description

Crop models are important tools for estimating crop yield and have been widely applied in risk assessment, field management, smart agriculture, and other aspects. This course will be in a workshop format, introducing the fundamental knowledge of crop models, and learning how to create process-based crop models (PBCM) based on the physiological mechanisms of crops, while understanding the application of existing PBCM in horticultural crops. Cropbox (https://github.com/cropbox/Cropbox.jl) is a crop modeling framework based on Julia language. In this course, students will have a walkthrough from simple to complex Cropbox models to learn how to solve research or practical cases they may encounter in the field.

### Course Objective

Students who complete the course will understand the basic knowledge of process-based crop models and their applications in horticultural crops. They will also be able to utilize the programming language or modeling framework used in class to create a simple crop model in accordance with the physiological mechanisms of crops.
