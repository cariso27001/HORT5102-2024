# Homework 4

Please read the selected literature and summarize the content of the paper, including but not limited to the background of the model, the mechanism of the model, the model's performance, and the limitations of its application. You may also include discussions or comparisons with other models based on the knowledge you gained during this 4-day course.

The summary can be submitted in either a document format (up to 4 A4 pages) or a presentation format (up to 40 slides).
